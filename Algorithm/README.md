The algorithm of polynomial factorization is Kroneck Factorization.

The algorithm of multiplication uses FFT.

>> Actually our algorithm of division support the degree of 10000, addition & subtraction & multiplication support 1000000. But considering Internet transportation, we set the limit 1000.
